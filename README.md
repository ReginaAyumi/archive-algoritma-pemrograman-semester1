## Project UTS
1. Algorithm Days_Calendar
This algorithm receive input number of days in a month and the start day, example, 1 is Monday, 2 is Tuesday, etc. Print the number of days to the calendar template. After Sunday, it goes back to Monday again.
2. Algorithm Password_Validation
This algorithm receive input of password and compare it with the constant password. If same, then the password is valid.
3. Algorithm Duration_Difference
This algorithm receive input of two times of hh:mm:ss. Convert it to the seconds and find the difference.
4. Algorithm Decimal_to_Binary
This algorithm receive input of decimal number and then convert it to binary number. Display it to the output device.
5. Algorithm Amount_of_Even_Numbers
This algorithm receives input of some data. Then calculate how many even numbers are there and display it to the output device.
6. Algorithm Power_Number
This algorithm receives input of power number. Calculate it and display it to the output device.
7. Algorithm Days_in_Month
This algorithm receive input number of month and year. If the input of month is 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, then the days will be 31. If the input of month is 4, 6, 9, and 11, then the days will be 30. If the input of month is 2, the output is depends on leap year.

## Project UAS
This problem use various structures/concepts in C++, for example conditional selection,  looping, function, procedure, array, string, searching, and sorting. The concept of this problem is making a menu which has several program options. I use looping (do-while) to display menu on loop when the user want to display menu again. Main menu using procedure to run the program based of the number that the user input. The procedure for main menu use conditional selection (switch case).

The first program is palindrome. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward. The example is madam or racecar. This program mostly use string structures, like input string and reverse string. For this program, I use function to check whether the word is palindrome or not. It receives input of word from main program, and then go to function to check. If the reverse of the word is the same with the input word, then it will return “palindrome”, and if it is not same, the function will return “not palindrome”.

The second program is search students by the score. Like the name, the purpose of the program is to search student with specific score. It uses searching structure that involves array for the student data input, string for input student’s name, conditional selection (if-else) to display the students with input score, and looping (while) to search student with input score. It receives input of array that includes student’s name, NIM, and score from the user and then ask user to input the score they want to search. The output of this program if the score found in array is the student’s name, NIM, and score with the input score. If the score does not found then write “Score not found”. I use procedure for input array because it is used in program 2 and 3.

The third program is sort student by the score. Almost the same with program 2, but we sort all students based on their score from the lowest to the highest. First, input array of student’s name, NIM, and score. Then, we sort the score using selection-sort maximum. This program use for-loop to display the result of sorting.
